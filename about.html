        <h3>Micro-Manager</h3>
        <p>Est. is the year of 2022; the Fantastic Four hold the four chairs to the keys to the castle. We're coders, in that we require stimulation to our brains, In that is a problem.
          Life moves faster than the Earth can spin ( trust us we know), so the friendly Four decided that "we can help these lost people. " Introducing the Micro-manager! Its an all-inclusive 
          structure bringing helper that will keep you on track while on any project. Foundation in structure; its a modern easy to navigate project manager that can only do one thing which is help. 
          
          We focused on time; on its importance and its monatary nature. From having a timer to keep track of productive labor hours all the way, to weather updates so that you'll never be late; 
          the Micro-Manager manages to deliver every time.</p>
